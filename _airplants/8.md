## The one with the inflorescence that stalled

This plant I honestly thought had died. These take startlingly more water than I was providing it. Once I got wise to this, it started to look up, but I don't think the blooms will emerge. This had a spike on it when I bought it.

I have changed my mind on this species--I didnt like it, but now that I understand it better, I do.

Growing it inverted seems to allow the leaves to unfurl and look longer.
