## Purple!

I bought a mess of plants in a mystery box on Black Friday. This is one.

Here's the booking photos for your enjoyment.

Different "flavors" of capitata look similar to me. This is the type that come from Dominican Republic (hence dominguensis). I have a hard time seeing this as the same species as my other capitatas, but I think scientists are [also challenged](https://www.fcbs.org/articles/t_brachycaulos_capitata_Complex.htm). It appears to remain purple even if it's not blooming (mine is not).
