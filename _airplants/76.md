## My tallest air plant

This is kind of a showstopper. I potted it in orchid bark right after I got it, hoping to see strong growth (and good pupping). It came to me with six bracts, none yet open. So it's ready to bloom and from there produce hopefully an army of pups for me.

Nice and green, just out of the box:

Showing quite a bit more curl after moving outside:

Hosting a spider and showing off the blush just before blooming:

And finally blooming in later June 2020:
