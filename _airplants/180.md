## strepto squad (4 of 4)

T. streptophylla is one of my favorite airplants. So when I had this big order, I added four smalls in. This one has some serious leaf weirdness. It's got a denser trichome covering, and the leaves are more succulent feeling, but also with some color strangeness and some splits in the leaves. I'm keeping an eye on this little mutant.

Here's the squad together for comparison. I now have 7 of this species.
