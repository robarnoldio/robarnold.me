## really long, soft leaves

I believe now this is just a capitata with a long leaf habit. But maybe it's a hybrid. The leaves are soft compared to all my other capitatas.

It shows signs of having been painted peach, but only on a couple outer leaves. Not sure what to make of that.

Shown here next to a "regular" capitata peach to highlight the similarities and differences.
