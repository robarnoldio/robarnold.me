## could be my favorite air plant

T. Curly Slim is a hybrid of intermedia x streptophylla. As of this order, I now have 4 of them, plus both parents (I have a few streptophyllas). I like growing them in pots, which they also seem to enjoy. I have fantastic root growth on my ones from April.

They open up considerably after a soak.

Here's all three smalls in matching pots.
