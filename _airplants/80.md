## This runt is growing quickly

I always envisioned xero as a slow grower, but mine are all growing vigorously. Go figure. Full sun for part of the day seems to be what they like. This one is hanging in the east, so gets morning light. I think this was once a bigger plant and the seller removed lower leaves that looked bad. But no complaints about the growth.
