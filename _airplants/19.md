## It's pronounced Bootsy-eye

Ahhh, the name is Butzii baby.

This plant is tough, and surviced me underwatering it severely for months. It seems to have a stump where an inflorescence as previously removed. As of May 2020 it's producing a pup at the base. I now have it hanging base upward in the back porch.
