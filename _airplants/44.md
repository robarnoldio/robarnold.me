## A snowball that is alive

This plant came with a pup, but the price tag was attached in a way that knocked it free of the mother. I kept it alive for a couple months before losing it to dehydration. These are supposed to make spectacular clumps, so I went on the lookout for another one that was clumping. (see #77).

This is the Ecuador form--the Peru form is apparently more caulescent.

Check out this time lapse of it drying after getting dunked:
