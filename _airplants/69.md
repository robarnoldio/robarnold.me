## bought in a mount on clearance

That fateful trip to the home center resulted in me buying two capitata that came in swing-style mounts (on clearance). This one was in near-dead shape with damage at the end of all the leaves. I removed several rotten leaves from the base, and this tough little customer bounced back. I held off giving it a number until I was pretty sure it was on a good path. Now it's growing as well as pretty much all my capitata peaches do.
