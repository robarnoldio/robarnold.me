## one of a pair

Pretty sure about the ID of these. I have another plant that is even more profoundly secund that could be also a kolbii, but has a much finer leaf texture.

!["Tillandsia kolbii"](/i/IMG_5824.jpeg "Tillandsia kolbii")

(this gives me an idea that I can build sub-index pages to aggregate all the plants of a single species)
