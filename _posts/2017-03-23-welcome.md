Hello reader. This is the beginning of a blog by a guy who has blogged since
about 2001 or so. This is the companion to my tech blog, so in this one I will
deal more with things I want to write about that aren't technical.

Back in the beginning of the cluetrain era, blogs were conversations. But
comment spammers killed that model. I have no intentions of enabling comments.
If you want to engage, send me email at the address found here.

To do list:
- [x] edit templates with categories
- [ ] figure out a tag cloud thing
- [ ] pick sensible permalink strategy
- [ ] futz with the templates some more
- [ ] get an image workflow I can live with

Here is a picture:
