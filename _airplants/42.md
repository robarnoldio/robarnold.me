## Didn't mean to buy it, but real glad I did

This was much less open when I bought it, not sure if that indicates it was dehydrated or well-hydrated. The pup was part of the appeal--I paid a decent price for it and didn't get an ID from the seller (not a nursery, a boutique shop). I hear these are hard to grow, but mine seems to be thriving, I especially see new growth from the pup and no drying or wilt on the leaves. Trying to water this one is a bit of a balancing act--it's quite green, so more mesic than xeric, but fine leaved so can't store water like a bulbosa may.

And it looks even more like a chasen than my juncea does.
