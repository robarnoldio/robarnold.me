## The tall one

These are common and relatively cheap. It seemed like I was getting a lot for my money when I bought it. I've since grown to dislike this species. It's very thirsty. On the plus side, it reminds me of a matcha whisk (chasen). It's not that it has the identical form, but the way the leaves curve back in to the center at the extremities is similar.

I think this plant has a hard time looking attractive. The outer leaves just look crunchy and dead even when they aren't.

As of Sep 2020 it's growing a pup (and some fine roots)
