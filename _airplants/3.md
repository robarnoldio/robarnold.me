## My favorite ionantha

This one is the glow up star of the whole batch.

I just randomly picked this out of the bin at the local garden center. I did not foresee the greatness it would attain. Shown below Oct 2019 right after I bought it.

It started to show very extended leaves, and then since I had the practice of drying it inverted, the fountain form sort of emerged. Jan 2020 shown below.

I liked it enough to mount it in a stand with a lapis sphere to keep it company. Glamour shot below is Feb 2020.

It kept on trucking, and I gave it increased waterings to avoid dry leaf tips. The leaf extension got serious enough to give the overall plant a spherical look. Or maybe it was absorbing big sphere energy from the lapis. Apr 2020 shown below.

Then the blush kicked in around May 2020, with the flowers emerging in early June.

This plant is not painted or enhanced in any way.

I'm looking forward to pups from this. If the genetics are this good, these should be winners.
