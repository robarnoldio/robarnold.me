# Fountain pens currently in my collection

About three years ago I got started with fountain pens. Cheap (about three bucks) Pilot Varsity pens in every color was the gateway drug. I am not going to count those on the list, but I still have them. They will not run out of ink for a long time, but eventually get disposed since they can't be refilled.

This first group is not inked, stored in case I want to break them out.

1. Ohto Dude (blue)
2. Ohto Tasche (blue) A pocket pen, similar to a Fisher space pen in size.
3. Ohto Dude (silver)
4. Ohto Dude (silver) new in packaging
5. Ohto Dude (purple) new in packaging
6. Ohto Dude (black) new in packaging
7. A. G. Spalding & Bros. 

 I like Lamy pens quite a bit. The 1.5mm nib is especially enjoyable. About half of these are inked, and I have yet to even try the LX.

8. Lamy AL-Star (pacific blue, 2017 limited edition) EF nib
9. Lamy AL-Star (vibrant pink, 2018 limited edition) M nib
10. Lamy AL-Star (bronze, 2019 limited edition) M nib
11. Lamy AL-Star (bronze, 2019 limited edition) 1.5 nib
12. Lamy AL-Star (black) M nib
13. Lamy AL-Star (graphite) 1.5 nib
14. Lamy LX (marron, 2019 limited edition) M nib new in packaging

 I really like Kaweco pens. Changing the nibs is part of the joy. None of my sports have the clip accessory. I found the anodizing on the black AL sports to be not very rugged, so I quit carrying them very rapidly and went back to brass, which is a tank.

15. Kaweco Brass Sport black F nib (my everyday carry pen)
16. Kaweco AL Sport (night limited edition) black EF nib
17. Kaweco AL Sport (night limited edition) black M nib new in packaging
18. Kaweco Sport maroon gold M nib
19. Kaweco Special AL black black EF nib (my desk pen)
20. Kaweco Copper Lilliput black F nib (my next everyday carry pen) new in packaging

 When I take my Brass Sport out in public to sign a charge slip, it invites a lot of comments. It has a soft patina from two and a half years of daily use. I'm really looking forward to switching to the Copper (solid, raw so it will get a patina) on the appropriate occasion.

21. Daiso plastic fountain pen, blue. 

It turns out a pen that sells for $1.50 and takes international refill cartridges is not disposable junk at all. This really writes nicely, especially considering price. This thing may deserve its own review page, we'll see.
