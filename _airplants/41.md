## pretty flowers

I bought this because it was showing its bloom spike. I didn't really know the blue flowers were yet to emerge, so that was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't labeled, but I'm pretty sure it's T. houston 'cotton candy' based on that being common.

I like the holder. I unfortunately did not give this plant adequate light, so it died almost immediately after blooming (April 2020).
