## onion-like appearance

This plant was big and had some leaf damage when I got it. Since then it is showing good growth internally and seems to really love being soaked. I partially dry it inverted in a one-liter carafe because it captures tons of water in the leaf gaps.

In May 2020 I noticed a pup forming at the base.

By July that got to be an inch long or so.

It lives in a basket with some friends.
