## unitentional buy

I really did not need another capitata peach (bought it unlabeled thinking it was harrisii). This is a super nice plant though. After a soak it glowed up really nicely. It is getting high sun on the south wall and loving it.

Looked a bit scrobbly in the booking photo.

Basking on the south wall.
