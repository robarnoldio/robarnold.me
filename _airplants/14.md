## 15 inch wingspan

Thanks to a friend I've identified this one pretty positively as a hybrid called sparkler (brachycaulos x concolor). This sort of reminds me I need to get a concolor.

As of Aug 2020 I am growing this big fella in a vanda basket and orchid bark. I feel like it wants to attain greatness.
