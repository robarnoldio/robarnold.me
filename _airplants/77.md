## destined to be a clump

This one will become a clump, which was a wish list item of mine. It came to me with four pups, ranging from almost unnoticeable to 1/5 size of parent.

Currently mounted outdoors in high sun using a glass hummingbird decoration as a holder.

This also came with a bonus hitchhiker seedling. I didn't notce the hitchhiker, even though I did notice the pups when I bought it.
