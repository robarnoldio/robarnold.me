## big and blushing

This one I needed because big plants rarely come up for sale locally that look this good, and the price was super attractive.

Installed in a cedar basket that I made. Media is orchid bark, but the basket is lined with sheet moss. Hanging in the west porch window, so it will get a lot of sunlight.
