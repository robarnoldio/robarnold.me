*Secret formula:* dissolve 1-1/4 teaspoons of sodium citrate in boiling water. Whisk in up to
one pound of shredded cheese (your favorite type). The sodium citrate prevents the emulsion 
from breaking, and you get a smooth, creamy liquid cheese that you can successfully reheat 
in the microwave.

Bonus use case: also makes great mac & cheese sauce--no powder for me!
