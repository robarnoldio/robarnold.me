## a succulent form of ionantha

Came unlabeled, but others in the same bin were labeled 'rubra hard leaf' which is a thing I haven't seen before. Beginning to blush already. Looks like it may devlop the fountain habit, so I grabbed it. It's got kind of a wonky shape, but it's clearly in superb health.
