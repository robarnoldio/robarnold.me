## Fuzzy buddy

I bought a mess of plants in a mystery box on Black Friday. This is one.

Here's the booking photos for your enjoyment.

I didn't know what species this was, until I did (thanks reddit). It's velvety feeling, but weird and smooshy at the base in a way that I found concerning (but seems to be normal). No idea about the name, I propose "T. smooshybutt" would be more descriptive.

Right now, this one has found a roommate--it lives atop my pothos climbing structure. I gets a little sun each day but is showing minimal growth (and not dying either).
