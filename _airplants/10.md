## Large and in charge

I bought a mess of plants in a mystery box on Black Friday. This is one.

Here's the booking photos for your enjoyment.

At the time, this was my biggest air plant. I later got an ID from the seller it is T. secunda.

Many of the outer leaves have died off, but the plant is alive. It looks a little more normal now, but less impressively large.
