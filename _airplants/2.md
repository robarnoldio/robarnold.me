## The airplant in my nautilus

Here's where things started to go down hill, and I began my journet to being an airplant collector. #2 plant happened after I found this nautilus shell at a thrift store for a buck. My existing air plant looked like a tiny urchin rattling around in there, so I needed something in a bigger size. Afeter a quick trip to the local garden center, I came back with this plant, labeled capitata guzmanoides.

The -oides suffix indicates "resembles," so this name means it looks like a Guzmania (different bromeliad). I don't know about that. So, I paid way too much for this plant, but it was the only think they had in an appropriate size, and I got the nautilus for noting, so I decided it was worth it.

I got kind of lucky that this plant tolerated my low light where I was displaying it. It was too far from a window to thrive. Right now the shell sits empty and I have the plant outside with the collection for the summer.

I eventually figured out to stuff a crumpled sheet of paper into the shell to raise the plant out of the opening. It looks a bit better but more importantly the plant catches more light.

Does it look like a Guzmania: I think maybe the iea is that while in blush this may resemble a Guzmania, but I haven't seen that condition yet.
