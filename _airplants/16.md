## The second most mainstream airplant

My ID is based on the fact that this came to me looking pretty peach colored before it reverted to green. And they're crazy common, so it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a mystery box (filler). I later learned about T. riohondoensis being the current name, but almost no sellers use that.

Looking pretty peach the day it landed on my planet:

But green within a month or so.
