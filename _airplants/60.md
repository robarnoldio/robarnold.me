## sold to me as brachycaulos multiflora

Some of the tags from the distributor this shop buys from have been wrong. I have no good way to disprove this one, but it looks much more capitata than brachycaulos. And this name is perhaps entirely bogus--the capitata-brachycaulos group of plants is a mess in terms of nomenclature. Anyway, here's a nice, medium-sized plant.
