## bigger strepto

I picked this one from about eight, most of which looked super dry and stomped on. Mine has some leaf damage, but it won't show when it gets curled up tightly. Installed outdoors and growing relatively quickly.

I would like to get a bunch more streptos.

The basket this one rides in is mounted to the south wall beneath a hanging spider plant.
