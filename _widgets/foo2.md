# T. Curly Slim (streptophylla x intermedia)

!["T. curly slim"](/t/IMG_6292.jpeg "Curly Slim")
This is a curly slim. There are many like it but this one is mine. This one has a lot longer description though, because I'm using it to test the truncate filter and see if I can make the damn iterator do what I want it ot.
