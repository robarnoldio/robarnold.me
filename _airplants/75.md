## the airplant that sounds like it came from the wild west

Curly Slim is a hybrid of T. streptophylla (one of my favorites) and T. intermedia. It keeps the curly habit of the strepto, but gets quite tall and sometimes has pups viviparously like intermedia. these are popular, and I can sure see why.

When it's fully hydrated, it extends its leaves considerably

Then it returns to curly habit as it dries out.

It has a base similar to a streptophylla.

Mine is tolerating high light very well.

As of June 2020 I potted the small one in orchid bark as well.
