## boxing day present to myself

Local store had this thing for at least a year. The price tag fell off eventually and so I asked them what they wanted for it and bought it at a substantial discount (paid asking price). I kinda stole this one.

The outer leaves have some blemishes but they only show up when wet. New center growth looks really good. I think this thing will glow up substantially under my grow lights. I would like it to get really large, but hard to know if that's in the genetics.
