## a probable ionantha x magnusiana (?)

This plant is "enhanced," or painted, which is a dman shame. It's a very delicate leaf with the texture of a magnusiana but in an ionantha-like shape. I bought two--didn't figure out it's enhanced iuntil I got it wet. When dry it just looks silver and pretty.
