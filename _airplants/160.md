## voted off Tillandsia island

Wallisia cyanea or pink quill plant used to be called Tillandsia cyanea.

This one is usually grown in pots. I grabbed this at the home center for a buck becuase its pot was damaged. It is also post bloom, so the big show is over for the mother plant, but two pups are developing nicely.

It's finished blooming, and I bought it that way, but I'm getting three pups now.

January 2021 update: at least three pups and growing strong. Fantastic color.
