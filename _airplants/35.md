## Another loss

T. houston is a hybrid that's been around a while from what I read. This one came labeled, and what I didn't grasp is the black was dye added by the distributor. I'm done buying "enhanced" plants, so I don't feel awful about losing this one. Hybrids of stricta and stricta do not thrive for me.

No images. I bought this after doing my big push to photo the collection, and did not do a booking photo of it before losing it.
