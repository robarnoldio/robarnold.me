## another fragrant one

T. crocata large form is noticably more robust than crocata Brazil. Both should have fragrant orange flowers (both came from BRT, so I'm reasonably comfortable with the IDs). It's already a small clump, and has the extremely long trichome coat that my other crcata does. Really cool plant.
