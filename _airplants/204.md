## a very happy trade

This is a streptophylla hybrid, not clear what the other parent is. It put on a serious blush under the grow loghts, and is curling up to resemble its famous parent.

Very dark leaf bases, but that's hard to photograph

Blushing and curling but also showing strong new growth.
