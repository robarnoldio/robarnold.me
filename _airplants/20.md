## Enchantment under the sea dance

This is one of the three plants that I immediately put into sea urchin shells and hung inverted. For that readon there's no "booking photo" of it.

This one was one of my most immaculate air plants, until I dropped it and broke a leaf. As of May 2020 it has at least one pup growing, but hasn't flowered.
