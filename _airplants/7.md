## The red one that turned green and then red again

Like #4, this one was painted by the seller (the distrubutor the seller uses). Unlike #4, at some point this one stressed out, the leaves shrunk, and then I was able to reomve a bunch of the paint, getting it back to something like green.

Here it is right after I bought it in Nov 2019.

And the booking photos from January 2020 when I decided to get organized.

This shows it alongside its sibling after I removed a bunch of paint. This plant is unfortunately stressed. The other is not, so I couldn't get the paint to rub off. But #7 is green again! Mixed blessings I guess.

Same two plants from below.

Wait, what's this? I put this under my grow light to respond to the stress and held back water. I realized I was ~~probably~~ definitely overwatering. Lo and behold it started to blush like a plant going into bloom...

...which in fact it was.

So why not pollinate? I had this ionantha clump blooming, and this cross is named "Victoria, so I decided to try it, even though between us I think #7 is doomed.

Number 7 is currently parked on my north facing office window so I can watch it. The story continues to unfold.
