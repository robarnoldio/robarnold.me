## bought in a mount on clearance

That same fateful trip to the home center resulted in me buying two capitata that came in swing-style mounts (on clearance). This one was in decent shape and glued in to the holder, but loosened immediately on soaking.

These did not come labeled, so I'm using hte mane most commonly referred to. These are arguably riohondoensis.
