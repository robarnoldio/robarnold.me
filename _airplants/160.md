## voted off Tillandsia island

Wallisia cyanea or pink quill plant used to be called Tillandsia cyanea.

This one is usually grown in pots. I grabbed this at the home center for a buck becuase its pot was damaged. It is also post bloom, so the big show is over forthe mother plant, but two pups are developing nicely.
