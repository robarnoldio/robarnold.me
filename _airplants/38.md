## Another casualty from the painted plant section

This one died Apr 2020. No pictures, and the paint on this one was at least a good "makeup artist" job of what ha harrisii should look like, with purple leaf tips. But once I obtained an unpainted one, this was obviously enhanced. I'm not all that sad to lose it.
