## Bloomed for weeks

I'm perhaps proudest of this one. It was not even showing signs of blooming when I bought it in January, but by February was starting the lengthy process. As of now, it's done and has two pups growing. This is a huge part of the fun for me.

Budded Feb 8, 2020:

Full inflorescence emerged by Mar 25, but still green

Now starting to blush and flowers peeking out Apr 25

Finished the bloom process by Jun 5. I do expect seeds from the pollination, but that won't be a quick process either. More updates as that unfolds.
