Opinions expressed in this blog are not those of my employer. If you're looking
for my writings on technical subjects, try <http://www.robarnold.io>.

On this blog I aim to present my thoughts on a few of the principles by
which I organize my personal life. I try to occupy a position closer to
producer than consumer on the spectrum of choices, so you'll find a decent
amount of material explaining the why and how of the things I make. I learn a
lot by making stuff, so I will share some of that too.

I've had blogs for more than 15 years, and the concept of comments from the
readers is something that I expect to miss. I like it much better when blogs
are conversations, but conversations about knockoff designer handbags or
fanciful pharmaceuticals don't interest me. So for now the comments are off.

If you have a strongly held position on blog comments, you are invited to let me
know where you stand.

Privacy policy coming soon, but for now I don’t collect info from you. GitHub
is hosting these pages, so it might, but I can’t see any of it. No ads here.

I’m editing this site in Atom on a MacBook Air. I use Firefox with NoScript and
uBlock Origin. JPEG pictures you see were probably shot on my iPhone.
