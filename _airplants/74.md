## still waiting to see the orange flower

Regular crocata has a yellow flower, this is suppsed to be the orange flower version. It came with one spent bloom and one that had yet to open.

This is growing extremely nicely for me, with new shoots all over. It should become a nice clump in the couse of this summer.

Cool habit with long stems that branch out from the base of the plant.

Zoomed in a bit you can see the long trichomes giving it a furry texture. This is a soft plant.
