## A tragic loss

This plant died Feb 2020 of rot. Part of the point of this index of my collection is to document what didn't work. I watered this plant badly, adn it made me rethink my entire care program (not for the first time either).

I was attached to this plant having brought it back from a vacation in San Diego. It's not from one of the bigger suppliers in that area though. I really was taken by the UFO-like shape of it.

RIP. I now have two of these that are doing well since I learned how not to water this one.
