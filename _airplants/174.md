## could be my favorite air plant

T. Curly Slim is a hybrid of intermedia x streptophylla. As of this order, I now have 4 of them, plus both parents (I have a few streptophyllas). This one has interesting phyllotaxy, with sets of leaves that are opposed so it's a bit different looking. Small plants from Bird Rock are not expecially small, this is no exception.
