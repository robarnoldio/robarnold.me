This post will walk though the basic process I use to craft my own soap. I will
post separately about formulating soap--this is about the crafting.

My favorite current formula I have named "praise the lard." You may have
guessed that it has a good proportion of lard in it. Lard is low cost and
contributes some very favorable qualities to the bar.

I make a "two pound" batch, which really means two pounds of oils. Here's the
recipe:

| ingredient | quantity |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| lard | 18 oz. |
| olive oil | 13 oz. |
| coconut oil | 3 oz. |
| lye (NaOH) | 4.35 oz. |
| water | 12.2 oz. |
| fragrance oil | 1 oz. |


I do "cold process" soap making. I'm not providing heat to the process, so
saponification happens relatively slowly. This affords me time to work with the
ingredients and gives a smoother textured bar of soap than hot process.

I use five pound yogurt tubs to mix my oils in. The coconut oil and lard are
solid at room temperatures (they are saturated fats). I use an ice cream
disher (scoop) to remove and weigh the right amount of oils from my buckets. A
kitchen scale is accurate enough to weigh these amounts, for one important
reason. This amount of lye is discounted slightly to give a finished bar that
contains a small amount (5%) of unreacted oil. I've got real gripes about
the precision of household scales, but that's another post.

I warm my oils for about a minute in the microwave oven. This gets them to
about 110 degrees F, which melts it all together. For efficiency's sake, I
am in the habit of weighing up several containers worth of oils and storing
them with lids ready to grab when I want to make some soap.

I use the scale to get 12.2 oz of distilled water, then I weigh up the lye in a
separate glass bowl. Dissolving the lye in the water generates some nasty fumes
as well as heat, so I take things out to the garage for this step. Do not
add water to lye, always add lye to water. The solution we are making is strong
enough to burn you. You should probably wear gloves.

When the lye is fully dissolved, I add it to the oils in the yogurt tub. The
size of these tubs is close to ideal, with the mix filling the container about
two thirds full.

I have a stick blender I purchased at a yard sale that I use to emulsify the
oils and lye water. This emulsion is important to the reaction. Different oils
react at different speeds. My mix takes about 15-20 minutes to reach the state
called "trace" which is a persistent emulsion that looks like pudding. I don't
mix continuously.

Once the mixture achieves trace, I add my fragrance oil. If you add colors (I
don't) they go in now as well. Then mix everything together and pour into a
mold.

I crafted my mold (of course) from some scrap plywood. Even though I
standardized on two-pound batches a while ago, my mold has the ability to place
the ends for a bigger or smaller batch. I line my mold with freezer paper.

I smooth the top out with the spatula that I use to scrape the mix out of the
yogurt bucket. After 24 hours or so the soap has set up enough to pull the
loaf out of the mold, but I leave it in the paper for another day.

After soap has firmed up a couple days, I slice one-inch thick bars from the
loaf. Soap you craft has to cure for six to eight weeks to be it's best. You
have soap the day you cut the bars, but it performs much better when you let the
moisture work its way out of the finished bars. Some people weigh the soap
to determine when it's done, but I just wait eight weeks.
