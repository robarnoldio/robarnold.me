## Let's get weird

This plant is weird. Besides a goofy shape, it has leaves that are more tubular than almost any other air plant, and has less pronounced trichomes (the fuzz) than most all of them. On the "green to white" airplant continuum, this plant is the green extreme.

I currently have this suspended with the base up, and a sea urchin shell on the hanger wire. I water it a lot and keep it out of the sun. It seems to like outdoor life much better than indoors.

TODO: take a current pic of this one
