## has a lot of pups, drops a lot of pups

I haven't made peace with this plant. It came with several pups, two detached in shipment and I've stuggled to keep them alive. One more dropped recently, leaving one attached but it will be dropping iminently as the stem end withers.

Luckily, it seems to be growing at the other end, but I just don't feel like this plant is doing optimally for me.
