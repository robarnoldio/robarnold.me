## The fleeting joy of pups

This one came with a pup attached! Bonus! But it stayed attached maybe 10 minutes. And long story short, I did not nurture it successfully into adulthood. RIP little ion.

What makes this a "Guatemala" flavor is the slenderness of the leaves while still adhering to the short conical rosette look of a typical ionantha. Easy to grow, prolific, and colorful.
