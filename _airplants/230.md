## my second chiapensis at a bargain price

I got this for 3 bucks because the store had it in stock long enough that the price marks were gone. It was there when I bought my first one in May. I had been passing on it because it's not as nice as mine (plus mine has a pup), but for the fire sale price I can put up with that.

These grow super slowly. I think it's gonna like the lights, but it has some crunched up leaves from getting handled that will probably take a year to grow out.
