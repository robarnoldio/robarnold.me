## first of three

Purchased enhanced peach color. Looks like an ionantha hybrid. Decided later that it is "Victoria," ionanatha x brachycaulos.

Grew into a very fountain-like habit.

All three of these threw a single pup without blooming first, and the pups are now (Jan 2021) around half the size of the parent.

The paint is deteriorating, but it really doesn't seem like it affected the plant's growth.
