## a bonus plant that was a real bonus

This came free with my order from Bird Rock Tropicals. I couldn't be happier with the plant or the order honestly.

At first it looked like a shaggy, large ionantha. It is failing to upstage XL curly slim in the foreground of this photo here.

Then when it went into bloom the show really started. Bright color for about three weeks and flowers for a week.

The red is more intense when it's wet. In photos the trichomes reflect a bit of light and make it appear less vivid, so here's a closer approximation.
