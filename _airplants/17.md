## Probably not dwarf yellow, but who knows

Looking a bit yellow out of the box, and decidedly dwarfish (or maybe it's a young plant).

Another capitata flavored small plant. I am skeptical about it being dwarf yellow for reals just because those run expensive, so not a likely find in the mystery box (but who knows?)
