## The one with the inflorescence that stalled

TODO: get a nice pic

This plant I honestly thought had died. These take startlingly more water than I was providing it. Once I got wise to this, it started to look up, but I don't theink the blooms will emerge. This had a spike on it when I bought it.

I have changed my mind on this species--I didnt like it, but now that I understand it better, I do.
