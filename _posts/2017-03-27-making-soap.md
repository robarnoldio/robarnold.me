This post will walk though the basic process I use to craft my own soap. I will
post separately about formulating soap--this is about the crafting.

My favorite current formula I have named "praise the lard." You may have
guessed that it has a good proportion of lard in it. Lard is low cost and
contributes some very favorable qualities to the bar.

I make a "two pound" batch, which really means two pounds of oils. Here's the
recipe:

| ingredient | quantity |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| lard | 18 oz. |
| olive oil | 13 oz. |
| coconut oil | 3 oz. |
| lye (NaOH) | 4.35 oz. |
| water | 12.2 oz. |
| fragrance oil | 1 oz. |
