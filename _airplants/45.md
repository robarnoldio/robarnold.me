## My first mutant

"Druid" is the name of an albino/leucistic strain of ionantha. It may not look all that different to a notrmal one until it lowers, and the flower is white instead of purple. Mine has yet to flower, and I didn't buy it with the "Druid" label on it, but for the price I'm pretty sure that's what I bought. It may also be a "peach" but I don't think so.

I see good growth from this one and am optimistic I'll be posting bloom shots in a couple months.

After trimming the roots, it's housed comfortably in the piece of wood (grape root I think).
